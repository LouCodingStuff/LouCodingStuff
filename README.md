 # Hi there 👋
 ## About Me:
- My name is Lou and I'm 18.
- I have Autism & Dyslexia (Please make pulls to fix my spelling)
- I've always loved coding since a young age and i am looking to take a creative computing course at Portsmouth Univerity Soon...
- Im very interested in AI and think its going somwhere great. 
- If you want to message me, idk figure it out, open an issue maybe? :D
- If you notice I had little commits on my projects it's because I like to perfect them before I upload them. I think it looks nicer and people can't judge my edits lol.
- Also mushrooms are cool 🍄🍄
